      <h2>Where've I been</h2>
      <p>
        I actually moved to B'ham in middle school. Before that, I lived in Huntsville, AL from the time I started 1st grade. My family moved to Huntsville when I was in Kindergarten. Before that we lived in Springfield, VA. Before that, I was born in Framingham, MA. I don't really have many memories of any of those places though, and I don't have any particular attachment to them, so I usually start my reckoning with Birmingham. That's the first place I really identify with.

      <h2>Where I'd like to go</h2>
      <p>
        Just making stuff up here. Haven't been to Portland before, but a friend lives there and it sounds cool. Like Denver's sister city in a lot of ways. My brother has been to Vancouver a couple times. New York is a place you're supposed to visit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Portland</strong></li>
        <li><em>Vancouver</em></li>
        <li><strong>New York?</strong></li>
